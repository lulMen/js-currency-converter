# Overview

This project is a Currency Converter web application designed to deepen my understanding of the JavaScript language and its integration with APIs. Through this project, I aimed to build a practical tool that converts amounts between various currencies using real-time exchange rates. This application showcases my ability to manipulate the DOM, handle asynchronous API calls, and create user-friendly interfaces.

The primary goal of this project was to demonstrate the use of JavaScript for developing functional and dynamic web applications. By working on this project, I explored important concepts such as event-driven programming and error handling.
